# AirBnB clone - The console

We are Software Engineer students at  [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) and as part of our trip we have to create an AirB&B clone. At this step we'll be writing a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.

## Project scope
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.\
As part of it we will:
- Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of our future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel.
- Create all unittests (at least we'll try) to validate all our classes and storage engine.

#### Through the command interpreter it's possible to:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## General Requirements
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- Our code would use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All classes and modules and functions will be documented
- Our command interpreter should work in interactive and non-interactive mode.
